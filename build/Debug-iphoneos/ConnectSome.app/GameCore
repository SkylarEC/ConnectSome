GameCore is the core of the Connect Some game.  In the absolute center is the n-In-A-Row game engine, written and developed
by Keith Pomakis (www.pomakis.com).  You should not have to touch this code, as there is a CSGameCore wrapper around it.  You
should be working with that instead.

CSGameCore is the actual object you will be working with, designed to abstract the game internals and make the function calls
more Objective-C friendly.

As of the current date, the GameCore will only allow one instance of a Connect Some game at one time.


Whereas the internal game workings are contained within the CSGameCore object, all the Connect Some game's storage is 
accessable within the CSSettingsController.  This object exposes methods to set or read important data as well as a few methods
designed to remove a layer of obfuscation around the values for /some/ keys and allow for easier user workability.
